# Who I am?
Just unkown person that nobody knows and nobody should know, but for some reason I decided to

# Future projects?
Due to covid I became overweight and I have problems to manage todo something beside work,
but I want to provide websites and servers for amount of tasks, for example gaming solutions,
pokemongo social community collectors, etc.  
Now I just try to lose weight and I'm not addicted to sitting beside computer for 12-24 
(or even 30 hours) in stack as it was before. 
People started being more important for me than "just" devices.
So, gonna see in half year what I will do, but trust me, I will do something... I believe.
